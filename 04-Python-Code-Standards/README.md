# Programming Style

It is like putting the toilet seat down after you done using the toilet - a good habit. It doesnâ€™t improve the operation of the toilet, but it makes the experience nicer/easier for the person who uses it after you.

Consistency is important - choose a style guide and stick to it forever!

## Guides

- Most common: PEP8 (_Python Enhancement Proposal 8_)
- Also see: Google Python Style Guide (_dos and donts for Python programs written at Google_)

## Tools

- used for checking adherence.
For example, `pylint` can be used for
  - checking line-code's length,
  - checking if variable names are well-formed according to your coding standard
  - checking if imported modules are used
- turn adherence into a year-end-performance evaluation metric for programmers

## Best Practices

Read through PEP8 for advice around styling

- Indentation (4 spaces)
- Maximum Line Length (79 for code, 72 for comments)
- Blank Lines (2 lines around functions, classes)
- Imports (separate lines, grouped by standard library, 3rd party, local application)
- Whitespace (after commas, around operators and = sign, except function parameters)
- Naming Conventions (for Variables, Functions, Modules and Classes)
- Docstrings, Comments and README.md
