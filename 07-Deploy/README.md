The next step in the DevOps Maturity Model is Continuous Delivery (CD).

CD is a guided process involving all of the steps of design, coding, tracking, testing and release. It involves an agile mindset of releasing smaller, faster, and automated bits of code into the process rather than waiting for several changes to integrate at once.

Continuous Deployment means _automating the build_ so that changes happen automatically, and are pushed all the way out to the end user’s software.

Imagine a smartphone app that can take a picture of a plant and identify it. The ML Engine within this application is a trained model, and perhaps you make a change that improves the recognition score. Once tested, your change would not only be placed into the build, but pushed all the way out to the user automatically – perhaps within minutes of the tests completing.
