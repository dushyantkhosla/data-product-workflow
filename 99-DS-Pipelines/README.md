## Primary Benefits

- _Automation_: We can run an end-to-end workflow with a single command by chaining tasks with explicitly defined dependencies.
- _Failure Handling_: A pipeline enables monitoring of a workflow by tracking the status of each task. In the event of a failure or interruption, we can alert a user and restart our pipeline from the last completed task.
- _Parameterization_: Variations of a workflow can be run with new data sources or model parameters by making changes to a single configuration file.
- _Testing_: Implementing tests into our workflow tasks ensures the quality of our data sources at each step and makes it easier to pinpoint errors.
